/* PianoWifi's network boundary (level 8, docs/drivers/wifi.md section 13.7): the two interfaces through which frames and keys
 * cross between PianoWifi (the kext that owns the chip and its data path) and the rest of macOS. C, no other header than
 * <stdint.h>, so that user space includes the same file the kexts do.
 *
 *   1. In the kernel, PianoWifi <-> PianoWifiEthernet (en0): 802.3 frames both ways and the link's state. PianoWifiEthernet
 *      links against PianoWifi (a library dependency) and calls the three functions below.
 *   2. Kernel <-> user space, the 802.1X port: a kernel control socket (PF_SYSTEM / SYSPROTO_CONTROL, root only, one client at
 *      a time) over which the four-way handshake runs in user space. EAPOL frames come up on it (never on en0), EAPOL frames go
 *      down on it, and the keys the handshake derives are installed and the port opened (authorized) through it.
 *
 * What never crosses either: the network's name, the passphrase and the PMK (user space has them: it wrote the join profile);
 * the kext logs lengths and states only, never an address, a frame's bytes or a key.
 *
 * All multi-byte fields are little-endian (the tablet's own order). Every structure is packed and has a fixed size; a message
 * is the header and then exactly the structure its type names (EAPOL messages: the header, a small fixed part, the PDU).

/* ============================================================================ 1. PianoWifi <-> PianoWifiEthernet (in the kernel)
 * Frames are Ethernet II as en0 carries them: destination, source, type, payload; 14 to PIANO_WIFI_NET_FRAME_MAX bytes, no
 * FCS. The station's frames must carry the station's own address as their source (the firmware drops others): en0 takes the
 * address PianoWifi publishes as the registry property piano-wifi-mac, and the link callback passes it again.
 *
 * Received frames: every frame of the associated access point except EAPOL (type 0x888e, which goes to the 802.1X port) is
 * given to `input`, on PianoWifi's own thread, only while the link is up. The frame lives only during the call (copy it).
 * Sent frames: piano_wifi_net_send copies the frame into PianoWifi's queue and returns at once; the queue is drained by
 * PianoWifi's thread. Only while the link is up (after the authorization): ENETDOWN otherwise.
 * The link: `link(ctx, 1, mac)` when the port is authorized (open networks: right after the association; WPA2: when the
 * 802.1X client sends PIANO_WIFI_8021X_AUTHORIZE), `link(ctx, 0, mac)` when the association ends. */

 * The exchange for WPA2-PSK (the four-way handshake and the group key, IEEE 802.11 section 12.7):
 *   kext -> client  LINK          on connect, and again at every change: state ASSOCIATED, the generation, both addresses,
 *                                 both RSN elements (what the handshake's MIC and its checks need)
 *   kext -> client  EAPOL_RX      message 1 (and 3) of the handshake from the access point
 *   client -> kext  EAPOL_TX      message 2 (and 4): the kext adds the Ethernet header (to the access point, from the station)
 *   client -> kext  KEY           the pairwise key (TK) once message 3 checked out; then the group key (GTK, its index and RSC)
 *   kext -> client  RESULT        for each KEY: the firmware's completion (status 0 is success)
 *   client -> kext  AUTHORIZE     the port opens: data frames flow and en0's link comes up
 *   kext -> client  LINK          state AUTHORIZED
 * Open networks need none of it: the kext authorizes by itself and the client only sees LINK messages.
 * Every request names the generation of the LINK message it answers; a request of an older association is refused (ESTALE),
 * so a slow client can never install a key into the next association.
 *
 * Order rules the firmware imposes (the kext enforces them): the pairwise key before the group key (a group key that comes
 * first is held and installed right after the pairwise key's completion); EAPOL_TX only while the state is ASSOCIATED or
 * AUTHORIZED; KEY and AUTHORIZE only while ASSOCIATED or AUTHORIZED. */
