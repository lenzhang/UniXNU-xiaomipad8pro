// PianoWifi level 6, the ladder: the copy engine (WifiCe.h), the host transport (WifiHtc.h) and the firmware's message interface
// (WifiWmi.h) as one step machine the owner steps with a clock, so that a host test drives exactly what the kext drives (tests/
// wmi_host.cpp, against a model of the copy engine and a firmware that speaks the transport and the message interface). New code
// for this repository.
//
// The steps, each with its own deadline (piano-wifi-wmitimeout, and piano-wifi-scanwait for the scan itself):
//   601 the transport's ready       <- the firmware speaks first: its credits and its credit size
//   602 the message interface       -> connect that service, and take the endpoint its answer gives
//   603 set-up complete             -> the handshake's last control message
//   604 the chip's capability       <- the service-ready event (radio chains, bands, how much memory it wants: none here) and
//                                      the one or two extended ones behind it, which this firmware's own host waits for too
//   605 the host's initialisation   -> the resource configuration
//   606 the firmware is ready       <- the ready event, with the chip's own MAC address
//   607 a station virtual device    -> created, never started (a scan needs no started device on this chip)
//   608 a passive scan              -> the channel list of WifiHw.h
//   609 the scan's results          <- started, one management frame per beacon or probe answer, completed
//   610 the teardown                -> the scan stopped if it still runs, the virtual device deleted, the rings disabled
// Level 6 ends there: no association, no keys and no data path (levels 7 and 8).
//
// Every command the machine wants to send is written down as the one command outstanding and sent by the next turn, because a
// command of the firmware's message interface costs credits and a turn may find none left: a credit wait is not a failure, and
// the step's deadline is what decides. Nothing here allocates, maps or sleeps.
